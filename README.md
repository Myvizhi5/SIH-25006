## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
1.Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
The proposed solution is a Digital Biosecurity Farm Management Portal that enables farmers to assess, improve, and monitor biosecurity practices. Key features include:

Biosecurity Self-Assessment Tool: A questionnaire-based tool that generates a farm risk score and customized improvement steps.

Training & Learning Hub: Videos, infographics, checklists, and tutorials in multiple languages.

Compliance Tracker: Digital logs for disinfection, visitor entry, feed management, waste disposal, and vaccination schedules.

Alert & Notification System: Real-time disease outbreak alerts, SOP reminders, and breach warnings.

Farm Dashboard: A simple interface for farmers to monitor daily tasks, health records, and compliance status.

Vet & Expert Connect: Option to consult veterinarians or extension officers via chat or call.

Data Analytics Module: Helps authorities analyze trends and plan targeted interventions.

How it addresses the problem
Provides a centralized platform for biosecurity knowledge.

Empowers farmers with easy tools to assess and manage risks.

Ensures real-time awareness of disease outbreaks.

Reduces information gaps through multilingual access.

Supports government agencies with surveillance data.

Helps farms maintain continuous compliance, improving national preparedness.

Innovation and uniqueness of the solution
AI-driven risk scoring & personalized recommendations.

Offline-first mobile support for remote villages.

Visual-first learning tools for low-literacy users.

Geo-tagged disease alerts based on proximity.

Integration with government livestock databases.

Simple farmer-friendly UI, unlike existing complex systems.

Technical Approach

(Insert flowchart or prototype images if required.)

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis
Technical Feasibility: Uses stable, well-supported technologies.

Operational Feasibility: Designed for farmers, vets, and authorities.

Economic Feasibility: Cost-effective deployment using cloud and open-source tools.

Potential challenges and risks
Low digital literacy among farmers

Limited internet access in remote areas

Resistance to technology adoption

Data privacy and security concerns

Strategies to overcome challenges
Provide voice-based navigation and simple UI

Include offline mode for poor connectivity

Conduct awareness workshops and training

Use secure authentication and encrypted data storage

## Impact and Benefits
